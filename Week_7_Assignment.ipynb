        "# Week 7: Inferential Statistics – Hypothesis Testing\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook explores key concepts in inferential statistics, focusing on hypothesis testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Population vs Sample\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Population:** The entire group of individuals or objects that you are interested in studying. It's the complete set of data points.\n",
        "*   **Sample:** A subset of the population that is selected for study. It's often impractical or impossible to study the entire population, so we use samples to draw conclusions about the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Sampling Techniques\n",
        "\n",
        "Various methods are used to select a sample from a population. The goal is to obtain a sample that is representative of the population to avoid bias. Some common techniques include:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Simple Random Sampling:** Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.\n",
        "*   **Stratified Sampling:** The population is divided into subgroups (strata), and then random samples are taken from each stratum.\n",
        "*   **Cluster Sampling:** The population is divided into clusters, and then a random sample of clusters is selected, with all members of the selected clusters included in the sample.\n",
        "*   **Systematic Sampling:** Every nth member of the population is selected after a random starting point.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hypothesis Testing: Null & Alternate Hypotheses\n",
        "\n",
        "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine if there is enough evidence in a sample to draw conclusions about a population. It involves setting up two competing hypotheses:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** A statement of no effect or no difference. It's the hypothesis that the researcher is trying to disprove.\n",
        "*   **Alternate Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha):** A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It's the hypothesis that the researcher is trying to prove.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of hypothesis testing is to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternate hypothesis, or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## p-values, Significance Levels (α)\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **p-value:** The probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated from the sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value suggests that the observed data is unlikely under the null hypothesis.\n",
        "*   **Significance Level (α):** A threshold probability that is set before conducting the hypothesis test. It represents the maximum probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (Type I error). Common significance levels are 0.05 (5%) and 0.01 (1%).\n",
        "\n",
        "If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level (p ≤ α), we reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than the significance level (p > α), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## T-tests & Chi-Square Test (Intuition only, no heavy math)\n",
        "\n",
        "These are statistical tests used in hypothesis testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **T-tests:** Used to compare the means of two groups. For example, you could use a t-test to see if there is a significant difference in the average test scores of two different teaching methods. The intuition is to see how far apart the means are relative to the variability within the groups.\n",
        "*   **Chi-Square Test:** Used to examine the relationship between two categorical variables. For example, you could use a chi-square test to see if there is a significant association between gender and preference for a certain product. The intuition is to compare the observed frequencies in each category to the frequencies that would be expected if there were no association between the variables."
